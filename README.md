# Introducction

We built some terrain and cosmonuclide accumulation models to interpret a cosmonuclide depth profile from a vertical core taken at the top of a [tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(rock_formation)) close to [Ben Avon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Avon).

# Core

A 3.5 m vertical core was taken inside a pothole at the top of the granitic tor. An extra "Top sample" was taken at the top surface of the tor, 123 cm above the base of the pothole.

# Cosmogenic data

## Concentrations

<sup>10</sup>Be, <sup>26</sup>Al, and <sup>21</sup>Ne concentrations were measured in quartz cores from the top and core samples.

_Sample concentrations are depicted with red stars and one-sigma uncertainties are represented by left and right-pointing triangles._

- Both <sup>10</sup>Be and <sup>26</sup>Al profiles show an exponential distribution with an apparent attenuation length of c. 0.5 m, similar to the spallation attenuation length in granites (ρ=2.6 g/cm<sup>2</sup>), which is Λ = 160/2.6 ≈ 60 cm. This is compatible with a near-surface accumulation, where spallation is the main process that produce cosmogenic isotopes.
- The <sup>21</sup>Ne profile also show a similar "near-surface" attenuation, excluding the top sample, thath show a <sup>21</sup>Ne concentration lower than the highest sample from the core. 
- The <sup>21</sup>Ne profile is more scattered than the <sup>10</sup>Be and <sup>26</sup>Al profiles and do not converge to a 0 concentration at depth. This is a typical distribution of stable cosmonuclides profiles, as the quartz accumulates <sup>21</sup>Ne since its formation. This apparent "extra" <sup>21</sup>Ne concentration of c. 20 Matoms/g can correspond, either to nucleogenic <sup>21</sup>Ne, either to <sup>21</sup>Ne accumulated several meters below the surface by muonic radiation.
- [<sup>26</sup>Al]/[<sup>10</sup>Be] ratios are between 6.3 and 10.4. This values are around surface production rate ratios (~7). This match a recent (not depleted) near-surface accumulation.
- [<sup>21</sup>Ne]/[<sup>10</sup>Be] ratios are between one and two orders of manitude higher than surface prodution rates (~4), even considering a non-cosmogenic [<sup>21</sup>Ne] of 22 Matoms/g (the lowest <sup>21</sup>Ne concentration).

This suggests that most of the <sup>21</sup>Ne formed near the surface (near-surface attenuation distribution) before most of the <sup>10</sup>Be and <sup>26</sup>Al, and then the quartz was shielded from comic radiation enough time for most of the <sup>10</sup>Be and <sup>26</sup>Al to decay. The recent near-surface exposure formed most of the <sup>10</sup>Be and <sup>26</sup>Al (natural ratios) and a small fraction of the toal <sup>21</sup>Ne concentrations.

## Surface production rates

We calculated the apparent <sup>10</sup>Be, <sup>26</sup>Al, and <sup>21</sup>Ne ages of the top sample using [The online calculators formerly known as the CRONUS-Earth online calculators v.3](https://hess.ess.washington.edu/math/v3/v3_age_in.html). We used the LSDn ages and the spreadsheet from the [Average cosmogenic production rate calculator](https://github.com/angelrodes/average_cosmogenic_production_rate_calculator) to calculte the surface production rates for <sup>10</sup>Be, <sup>26</sup>Al, and <sup>21</sup>Ne by spallation and muons, and their correspondig attenuation lengths, according to the approximations shown in [Rodés (2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/geosciences11090362).
